# Predicting Energy Imbalance in the German Electricity Grid with Data Analysis and Machine Learning tools

This project analyzes the predictive power of three classes of explanatory variables
in terms of quarter-hourly imbalance prediction: (i) weather variables, (ii) time variables and 
(iii) previous imbalances, using publicly available data and models including Logistic Regression, LDA, CART and 
Random Forest.

Preprocessing: Python, R
Analytical models: R
